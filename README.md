# NitroSniperSquad
Maybe the most performant Nitro Sniper on GitHub.

It uses multiple tokens to seek for nitros, but all the gift requests are executed with the same one.

## Build
Open `NitroSniper.pro` with Qt Creator, and click on build.

## Usage
Create a `tokens.txt` file in the executable's directory. The first line is reserved for the token you want to get the nitro with, and put all the tokens you want below it. (Don't forget to copy OpenSSL binaries next to the executable)

Format:

    NDalkugfFsrsdrgDRgdrgsggrs.X
    NDrmglihsergmoiehrgmo_irgg.X
    Mzergliuhgrlhlhglsrhglsihg.X
    etc...
